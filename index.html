<p>Mordel drove a shaft of metal downward into the snow.</p>
<p>He retracted it, raised it, held up a piece of ice.</p>
<p>"Regard this piece of ice, mighty Frost. You can tell me its composition, dimensions, weight, temperature. A Man could not look at it and do that. A Man could make tools which would tell Him these things, but He still would not know measurement as you know it. What He would know of it, though, is a thing that you cannot know."</p>
<p>"What is that?"</p>
<p>"That it is cold," said Mordel and tossed it away.</p>
<p>"'Cold' is a relative term."</p>
<p>"Yes. Relative to Man."</p>
<p>"But if I were aware of the point on a temperature scale below which an object is cold to a Man and above which it is not, then I, too, would know cold."</p>
<p>"No," said Mordel, "you would possess another measurement. 'Cold' is a sensation predicated upon human physiology."</p>
<p>"But given sufficient data I could obtain the conversion factor which would make me aware of the condition of matter called 'cold'."</p>
<p>"Aware of its existence, but not of the thing itself."</p>
<p>"I do not understand what you say."</p>
<p>"I told you that Man possessed a basically incomprehensible nature. His perceptions were organic; yours are not. As a result of His perceptions He had feelings and emotions. These often gave rise to other feelings and emotions, which in turn caused others, until the state of His awareness was far removed from the objects which originally stimulated it. These paths of awareness cannot be known by that which is not-Man. Man did not feel inches or meters, pounds or gallons. He felt fear, He felt cold; He felt heaviness and lightness. He knew hatred and love, pride and despair. You cannot measure these things. You cannot know them. You can only know the things that He did not need to know: dimensions, weights, temperatures, gravities. There is no formula for a feeling. There is no conversion factor for an emotion."</p>
<p>"There must be," said Frost. "If a thing exists, it is knowable."</p>
<p>"You are speaking again of measurement. I am talking about a quality of experience. A machine is a Man turned inside-out, because it can describe all the details of a process, which a Man cannot, but it cannot experience that process itself as a Man can."</p>
<p>"There must be a way," said Frost, "or the laws of logic, which are based upon the functions of the universe, are false."</p>
<p>"There is no way," said Mordel.</p>
<p>"Given sufficient data, I will find a way," said Frost.</p>
<p>"All the data in the universe will not make you a Man, mighty Frost."</p>
